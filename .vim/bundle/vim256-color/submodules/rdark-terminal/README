I ported the rdark colorscheme (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1732) to fit in a 256 color capable terminal.

Info: As the original background color is not available in 256 color mode
I've set it to black. But you can set the color your terminal should display
for black to #1e2426 and you will have almost a 1:1 copy of the gui scheme.
I also suggest to set the second black color to #2c3032. (It is the
background color which ist used for NonText)
If you're using a terminal which reads from Xdefaults (e.g. urxvt) you just
do this in your .Xdefaults:
*color0:     rgb:1e/24/26
*color8:     rgb:2c/30/32

This is a "chalkboard" green background Vim colorscheme featuring soft, yet highly readable contrasts. It is based on marklar.vim by SM Smithfield (vimscript #1483), which I like very much.
The GUI colors have been optimized for easy, equal contrast on a TFT monitor.  Main goal was to minimize eye strain when working in a mixed environment where during long edit sessions you have to switch to high contrast white background screens every now and then.
Additionally there have cterm colors been defined so they will look mostly identical on a 256 color (Linux) xterm.

(Tabula settings dialog is shown at bottom.)

Starting with v. 0.2 the colorscheme is adjustable either on setup or on the fly. To permanently redefine the defaults put these settings in your .vimrc file before the
        :colorscheme tabula
line, e.g.:
        :let Tabula_ColorPre = "red"

To redefine them on the fly call the built-in options dialog:
        :call Tabula()
from the Vim command line.
The new settings will be immediately effective as soon as control is back in the main dialog.
To get the defaults back issue
        :colorscheme tabula
again.
(This has changed from earlier tabula versions where this call was necessary to make the settings changes effective.)

Display Statements In Bold:
        Tabula_BoldStatement = 0    -- statements display not bold
        Tabula_BoldStatement = 1    -- statements display bold
Defaults to non-bold display.

Set GUI Cursor Color:
        Tabula_CurColor = 'blue'
        Tabula_CurColor = 'red'
        Tabula_CurColor = 'yellow'
        Tabula_CurColor = 'white'
Defaults to 'blue'.
NOTE: This works in gvim only. In a terminal (like xterm) the cursor cannot be changed.

Set Color For Preprocessor Statements:
        Tabula_ColorPre = 'blue'     -- purple-blue
        Tabula_ColorPre = 'red'	      -- orange-red
        Tabula_ColorPre = 'yellow'  -- lightgreen-yellow
Defaults to 'blue'.

Use Dark Error Background:
Sometimes desirable for less distracting error highlighting.
        Tabula_DarkError = 0        -- light error background
        Tabula_DarkError = 1        -- dark error background
Defaults to light error background.

Use multiple colors for constant values:
        Tabula_FlatConstants = 1    -- use one common color for all constants
        Tabula_FlatConstants = 0    -- use a different color for each constant type
Defaults to using one common color.

How To Display Ignore And NonText Characters:
        Tabula_InvisibleIgnore = 0    -- slightly visible
        Tabula_InvisibleIgnore = 1    -- invisible on standard background
Defaults to invisible display.

Show Line Numbers Underlined:
Sometimes useful to spot a line more easily.
        Tabula_LNumUnderline = 0    -- not underlined
        Tabula_LNumUnderline = 1    -- line numbers are underlined
Defaults to not underlined.

Let Search Occurrences Stand Out More Prominently:
        Tabula_SearchStandOut = 0    --- normal dark background display
        Tabula_SearchStandOut = 1    --- prominent underlined display
        Tabula_SearchStandOut = 2    --- very prominent display
Defaults to normal display.

How To Display TODOs And Similar:
        Tabula_TodoUnderline = 0    -- display on a blue background
        Tabula_TodoUnderline = 1    -- display them underlined white
        Tabula_TodoUnderline = 2	   -- display them bold
        Tabula_TodoUnderline = 3	   -- do not enhance them at all
Defaults to underlined display.

How to display typographic character values (bold, italic, underlined):
      Tabula_CharValuesColored = 0	colored in addition to typographics
      Tabula_CharValuesColored = 1	not colored, italics in terminal-based vim reversed
      Tabula_CharValuesColored = 2	not colored, underlined in terminal-based vim reversed
Defaults to a colored typographics character values display.
NOTE: "Colored" is to be preferred in terminal-based vim because there is no easy way to distinguish italic from underline. In this mode italics and underlined characters are distinguished by different color shades, both displaying not reversed (usually black on a white background field) which is easier to read.
Otherwise there are two non-colored modes:
- italics are shown reversed, underlines are shown underlined
or
- italics are shown underlined, underlines are shown reversed.
These sub-modes do not affect the GUI display, however, where italics and underlined always display as usual, only color coded or in the common text color.
